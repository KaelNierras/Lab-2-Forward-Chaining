## Forward Chaining
Forward chaining is a form of reasoning that starts with simple facts in the knowledge base and applies inference rules in the forward direction to extract more data until a goal is reached.
# Features
1. **Initial Fact:** Allows users to input facts into the system, providing the initial data for forward chaining inference. Each fact is separated with comma.

2. **Enter Rules(condition and action):** Enables users to input rules, specifying the logical conditions and actions that guide the forward chaining process. **Condition (use 'and' to separate multiple conditions)**

3. **Generate New Facts:** Utilizes the input facts and rules to generate new facts through the forward chaining inference mechanism. **The facts will be displayed if q is entered.**
